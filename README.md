<h2>Problem</h2>
Explore characteristics about drivers who are likely to accept coupons and who are not likely to accept coupons. For this, explore characteristics that have a higher acceptance rate for bar coupons and higher acceptance rate for coffee house coupons.

<h2>Summary</h2>
Based on the data recorded, we found that people who frequently visit bars, at least once a month, are more likely to accept a bar coupon. They are also likely to travel without kids, not be widowed, and be younger than 30 years old. The bar coupon accepters are also most likely to have a budget on spending as data suggests the income is lower than 50k.
<br>
<br>
For coffee coupons, as we narrowed down on a specific group, we found that the age group of the ones who are likely to accept coffee house coupon are likely to be younger than 37 years old and frequently visit, at least once a month. Out of this group, we found that 57% of this group had a destination of work or home. We also added group of people who are frequent visitors, but are single or unmarried and do not have children, and found that there is a 65% chance that someone who accepts a coffee house coupon meets one of this criteria.
<br>
<br>
Overall, it suggests that for both bar coupon and coffee house coupon, drivers that accepted these coupons are relatively young, have less family responsibilities and more socially outgoing.
<br>
<br>
Hypothesize: Coffee house coupons are likely to be accepted after work hours or before work hours, as data suggests a lot of people under the age of 37 who accepted a coupon had a destination of home or work.
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>Next steps</b></h2>
Further exploration should include time of day for coffee house coupons as well as other demographics and characterisics to narrow down specific attributes that affect the coupon acceptance rate.
<br>
<br>
The exploration could also include weather, to indicate which weather for people who visit coffee house frequently and are younger than 37 when on the way to home or work are likely to accept a coffee coupon or not, and also to find if time has a correlation with weather.
<br>
<br>
Another exploration could include finding the correlation between the distance to coffee shop and acceptance rate.
